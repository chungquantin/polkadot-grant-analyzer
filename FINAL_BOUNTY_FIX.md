# ✅ Final Bounty Amount Fix

## Problem Solved

The error was:

```
KeyError: 'bounty_amount'
```

This happened because there was still a reference to the `bounty_amount` column in the `show_grant_program_details` function, even though this column doesn't exist in the new data structure.

## ✅ Root Cause

The `show_grant_program_details` function still contained a bounty analysis section that tried to access the `bounty_amount` column, which was removed from the new data structure.

## ✅ Fix Applied

### **Before (Broken Code):**

```python
# Bounty analysis
bounty_amounts = pd.to_numeric(program_data['bounty_amount'], errors='coerce')
bounty_amounts = bounty_amounts[bounty_amounts.notna()]

if len(bounty_amounts) > 0:
    st.subheader("💰 Bounty Analysis")
    # ... bounty analysis code
```

### **After (Fixed Code):**

```python
# Bounty analysis (removed since bounty_amount not available in new structure)
# Note: Bounty amount data is not available in the current data structure
```
